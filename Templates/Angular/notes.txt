Basics of Angular:

AngularJS is a JavaScript web framework aimed to make web apps simple to build
  and easy to maintain.

-A module contains the different components of an AngularJS app.
-A controller manages the app's data. The controller links the view to the
  model, specifically with $scope.
-A directive defines scope. Directives handle DOM manipulation.
  -Directives bind behavior to HTML elements. When the app runs,
  AngularJS walks through each HTML element looking for directives. When it
  finds one, AngularJS triggers that behavior (like attaching a scope or
  looping through an array).
-An expression displays values on the page.
-A filter formats the value of an expression.

Typical basic workflow:
-Create a module, and use ng-app in the view to define the application scope.
-Create a controller, and use ng-controller in the view to define the
  controller scope.
-Add data to $scope in the controller so they can be displayed with
  expressions in the view.

Generalizations:

-A user visits the AngularJS app.
-The view presents the app's data through the use of expressions, filters, and directives. Directives bind new behavior HTML elements.
-A user clicks an element in the view. If the element has a directive, AngularJS runs the function.
-The function in the controller updates the state of the data.
-The view automatically changes and displays the updated data. The page doesn't need to reload at any point.
